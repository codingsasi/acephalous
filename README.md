# acephalous
An API first distribution and a responsive Angular Single Page App using Angular material.

Acephalous provides an Angular front-end and an API first Drupal back-end. Routing has been made simpler here by using the same routes from Drupal rather than re-inventing the wheel. Routing takes place in the Routing component in the Angular Single Page App. 

The purpose of this distribution is to create a fast, secure and small front end application while keeping all the Drupal 8 goodness like SEO, responsive images, routing, multilingual, easy content authoring, views. Basically Drupal acts like an smart content source and a JavaScript framework renders it.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` from the ng folder for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Run `lando start` from the drupal folder for a drupal dev server. When installing, select acephalous installation and you will get dummy content and it will immediately appear on the angular side. 


## TODO
1. Add support for views' routes.
2. Automates tests
3. Complete the routing logic. The idea is to use only Drupal routes.
4. Optimize front-end.
5. Solution for managing media assets. 

## Future
Provide support for React, Vue and other popular JavaScript frameworks.
